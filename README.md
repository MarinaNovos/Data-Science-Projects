Description:
- **project 1** - Dairy Farm Data Analysis. This project focuses on developing two predictive models to assist a dairy farmer in selecting cows for herd expansion. One model predicts milk yield, while the other estimates the probability of producing tasty milk, helping the farmer meet strict criteria of at least 6000 kilograms of milk per year and high-quality taste.
- **project 2** - Online Store Data Analysis. The task is to develop a solution that personalizes offers for loyal customers to increase their engagement and purchasing activity.
- **project 3** - HR Analytics. The project focuses on developing models to predict employee satisfaction and the likelihood of resignation based on survey responses, where satisfaction levels are quantified on a scale from 0 to 1
- **project 4** - Well Location Selection. In this project, we aim to determine the optimal location for drilling a new oil well by analyzing samples from three regions, each containing 10,000 oil fields with measured quality and reserve volume. Utilizing a machine learning model, we will evaluate potential profits and risks using Bootstrap techniques to identify the region that offers the highest profitability while ensuring a risk of losses below 2.5%.
